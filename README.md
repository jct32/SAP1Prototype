# SAP1Prototype

This is a simple prototype of the SAP-1 computer from "Digitial Computer Electronics" by Malvino and Brown.

Included is the Visual Studio Files for this program. You should be able to copy this repo and then load the solution in Visual Studio.

If that doesn't work there is a debug and release build that you can go into those folders and run the .exe.

The program takes a binary input and gives a binary output. It asks for the binary input for each of the 16 locations in memory. 

If you do not give a value (just hit enter) then a binary value of 0 is entered.

When entering your values for the memory, you enter a binary value with or without the leading zeroes

ex: 00001000 or 1000 

If a value that is greater than 8 bits is entered you will likely see a crash.

Please give me any feedback.
